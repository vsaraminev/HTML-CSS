                  Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only
                  astronomical object known to harbor life. According to
                  radiometric dating and other sources of evidence, Earth formed
                  over 4.5 billion years ago. Earth's axis of rotation is tilted
                  with respect to its orbital plane, producing seasons on Earth.
                  The gravitational interaction between Earth and the Moon
                  causes tides, stabilizes Earth's orientation on its axis, and
                  gradually slows its rotation.
